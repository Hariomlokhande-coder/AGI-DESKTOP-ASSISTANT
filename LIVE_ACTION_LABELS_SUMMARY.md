# Live Action Labels Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

The workflow monitor now displays **detailed, real-time action labels** in the terminal instead of generic categories or post-analysis summaries.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Real-Time Logger (`real_time_logger.py`)
- Added `_create_detailed_content()` method that generates app-specific action descriptions
- Improved formatting with bold labels and color-coding
- Now displays labels like:
  - `[APP OPENED] Opened Microsoft Excel - Workbook1.xlsx`
  - `[TYPING] Typing in Microsoft Excel: data entry...`
  - `[FILE ACTION] Saved file`
  - `[EDIT ACTION] Pasted in Microsoft Word`

### 2. Improved Window Monitor (`window_monitor.py`)
- Added `_is_new_app()` method to distinguish between opening new apps vs switching windows
- Enhanced logging with detailed labels:
  - `[APP OPENED] Opened Microsoft Excel` (for new apps)
  - `[APP SWITCHED] Switched to Microsoft Excel` (for app switches)
- Shows app name and window title in all log entries

### 3. Enhanced Keyboard Monitor (`keyboard_monitor.py`)
- Added detailed action labels for keyboard shortcuts:
  - `[FILE ACTION] Saved file - Ctrl+S`
  - `[EDIT ACTION] Copied - Ctrl+C`
  - `[EDIT ACTION] Pasted - Ctrl+V`
- Improved typing detection with character count:
  - `[TYPING] Typed 42 chars: some text here...`

### 4. Better Main Console Display (`workflow_monitor.py`)
- Added startup banner with example output
- Improved statistics display with runtime formatting
- Better visual separation between stats updates

## Example Output

When you run the workflow monitor, you'll now see output like:

```
======================================================================

You will see detailed action labels as you work:
